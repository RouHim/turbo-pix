# Agent Guidelines for TurboPix

## Project Context

Development/personal project - breaking changes acceptable, database can be recreated!

## Development Commands

**Backend:** `cargo run` | `cargo test` | `cargo clippy` | `cargo fmt`  
**Frontend:** `npm run lint` | `npm run format`

## Code Style

**Backend / Rust:**

- Iterator chains over loops: `.iter().filter_map().next()`
- Arrays over vecs: `[A, B]` vs `vec![A, B]`
- Error handling: `Result<T, E>` with `?`
- Imports: std, external crates, local (blank lines between)
- Zero warnings policy

**Frondend / Vanilla Javascript:**

- `const` over `let` (no reassignment)
- Arrow functions: `() => {}` over `function() {}`
- Template literals: `` `string ${var}` `` over `'string ' + var`
- When adding visible text to the frontend, add them to the `i18n` translation system.

**General:**

- KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid (DRY, YAGNI, etc.)
- SOLID principles (single responsibility, open/closed, etc.)

# Commit Gatekeeping

- Lint and format before commiting
- Tests must pass
- Meaningful commit messages

# Development pattern

- TDD: Test Driven Development, write tests first, then implement the feature
- BDD: Behavior Driven Development, focus on the behavior of the application, use GIVEN, WHEN, THEN style
- E2E: End to End testing, test the application as a whole, use Playwright or Puppeteer
- when changing static files, we have to rebuild the binary (cargo build --bin turbo-pix)
- **Avoid:** Hardcoded paths and fallback logic mask bugs


## Testing

* Test images and videos are located in `test-data/`

**E2E:**

- Start: `nohup cargo run &` + wait for `curl --retry 5 --retry-delay 2 http://localhost:18473/health`
- Use Playwright MCP (preferred) Tool - don't install as dependency - don't create manual e2e tests
- Test at `http://localhost:18473`
- Kill process after testing

## Common Issues

**UI state desync:** Update both: `appState.value = x; domElement.value = x;`

**Video bugs:** Use `[data-photo-id]` selectors, test GET/HEAD requests, verify `mime_type` in DB
